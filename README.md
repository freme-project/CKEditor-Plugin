# CKEditor-Plugin

## install

* download ckeditor from [here](http://ckeditor.com/download) (^4.5.X)
* unzip (root should be the same as the `ckeditor` folder in this root)
* also, download the plugin `notification`, and unzip it to the `plugins/` folder
* make sure the ckeditor is loaded with jquery and the jquery adapter (see `ckeditor/samples/freme.html` for an example)
* check out `ckeditor/samples/freme.html`, it's awesome!

## For Drupal installations
### Requirements
* CKEditor plugin installed: version >= 4.5
* jQuery >= 1.9. You can control the version of jQuery your Drupal installation uses by installing the [jQuery Update module](https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update)

### Instructions
* Clone the repository to some local directory
* Navigate into the downloaded plugin directory and find the 'freme' subdirectory under ckeditor/plugins
* Copy and paste the "freme" folder in your own Drupal installation's CKEditor module folder. The path to it should look like: <your_drupal_path>/sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins/ 
* Download the CKEditor Notification plugin from: [http://ckeditor.com/addon/notification](http://ckeditor.com/addon/notification). Place it in <your_drupal_path>/sites/all/modules/ckeditor/plugins/. 
* Navigate to <your_drupal_path>/sites/all/modules/ckeditor and add the following lines in the ckeditor.config.js file under the CKEDITOR.editorConfig variable:
`config.extraPlugins += (config.extraPlugins ? ',notification' : 'notification' );
CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal('notification', Drupal.settings.ckeditor.module_path+'/plugins/notification/');
config.extraPlugins += (config.extraPlugins ? ',freme' : 'freme' );
CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal('freme', Drupal.settings.ckeditor.module_path+'/plugins/freme/');`
* In your Drupal admin interface, navigate to "config/content/ckeditor/edit" and edit the CKEditor profile where you want the plugin to be included.
* Under the *Editor appearance* tab, navigate to the *Plugins* list and make sure that the options "Plugin file: notification" and "Plugin file: freme" are checked.
* In the same screen, edit the CKEditor Toolbar, so that it features the added FREME buttons, by dragging and dropping them.
* You are good to go! The buttons should now be visible in any form that uses the CKEditor Profile you defined.
