# CKEditor-Plugin

## install

* download ckeditor from [here](http://ckeditor.com/download) (^4.5.X)
* unzip (root should be the same as the `ckeditor` folder in this root)
* also, download the plugin `notification`, and unzip it to the `plugins/` folder
* make sure the ckeditor is loaded with jquery and the jquery adapter (see `ckeditor/samples/freme.html` for an example)
* check out `ckeditor/samples/freme.html`, it's awesome!
